      <p>Larry Gintz (official birth name Lorenzo Guintaine) is a man of many faces, one of them being baseball. As a former player for the Houston 
        Astros for three consecutive seasons and the Baltimore Orioles for two, as well as his stint as a Little League coach for various youth centers in Chicago, Newark, and Philadelphia during the 1980’s, Larry thought that the Great American Pastime would be his calling for life.<br><br>
        Unfortunately, all good things must end. Nothing is eternal. However, the closing of one door should ideally lead to the opening of another…<br><br>
        After a career-killing head injury resulting from a fly ball and an increasingly toxic habit for codeine, Larry was forced to settle down in his
        hometown in 5th Ward, Houston, and find a new calling. His pride may have been wounded beyond repair, but luckily for him, his love for
        codeine-promethazine cocktails was as pure as ever.<br><br>
        He began to make new acquaintances as the music scene in Houston’s ghettoes started to carve a niche for itself in the mid 1990’s. Many
        of these acquaintances were loyal fans (some of them even personal friends) of DJ Screw, a fellow Texan who needs no introduction for anyone 
        reading this. Taking full inspiration from the synergy of Screw’s trademark grey mixtapes and the Syrup, Larry went to work on his next
        endeavor in life: a creative one.<br><br>
        Along with the inner visions that he had attained during his many soul-searching codeine “trips,” Larry also found fresh inspiration in the
        imagery and language of the esoteric secret societies from centuries past, thus stirring up a potent mix of the designs that are featured on 
        these t-shirts, hats, etc. that you can now own for the first time in twenty years.<br><br>
        Drank up.
